    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Scientific Python Developer working at Zuru Tech.

I previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Group of Roberto Cerbino at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Vienna, and in the group of Francesco Sciortino at the Physics Department of the University of Rome La Sapienza. My academic research interests include the investigation of the structure and dynamics of complex colloidal suspensions using advanced optical techniques and the development of high-performance codes for experiments analysis (using Python and C++/CUDA).
