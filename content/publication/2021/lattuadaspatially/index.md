abstract: Gels of DNA nanostars, besides providing a compatible scaffold for biomedical applications, are ideal model systems for testing the physics of equilibrium colloidal gels. Here, using dynamic light scattering and photon correlation imaging (a recent technique that, by blending light scattering and imaging, provides space-resolved quantification of the dynamics), we follow the process of gel formation over 10 orders of magnitude in time in a model system of tetravalent DNA nanostars in solution, a realization of limited-valence colloids. Such a system, depending on the nanostar concentration, can form either equilibrium or phase separation gels. In stark contrast to the heterogeneity of concentration and dynamics displayed by the phase separation gel, the equilibrium gel shows absence of aging and a remarkable spatially uniform dynamics.
