abstract: By experimenting on model colloids where depletion forces can be carefully tuned and quantified, we show that attractive interactions consistently “promote” particle settling, so much that the sedimentation velocity of a moderately concentrated dispersion can even exceed its single-particle value. At larger particle volume fraction $\phi$, however, hydrodynamic hindrance eventually takes over. Hence, $v(\phi)$ actually displays a nonmonotonic trend that may threaten the stability of the settling front to thermal perturbations. Finally, by discussing a representative case, we show that these results are relevant to the investigation of protein association effects by ultracentrifugation.
